			<h2> Why do we care so much?</h2>
			<div class="box1">
				<p>Not only are otters incredible creatures that are adorable to look at, but they also are a key species in our marine environment. We care about otters because they eat sea urchins and other animals that graze on giant help. Sea otters eat about a quarter of their body weight each day to keep warm. Without sea otters, these grazing animals would eat all of the kelp and destroy our kelp forests. Kelp forests protect coastlines from storms and their health is vital to our coastal environment. Sea otter numbers are decreasing and our company has a goal to save their species and sell them to provide equilibrium in our marine environments. The kelp forests also provide habitats for many marine animals and absorb carbon dioxide that would be released into the atmosphere otherwise. There is also a much greater diversity of marine life found where sea otters live. Our company provides the best service for purchasing sea otters because we care about their well-being. We are aware of their role in the world and want to increase the number of sea otters in marine environments to see an increase in kelp forests and animal diversity. We treat our otters with extreme care, looking after their health, grooming, and diet and sell them only to the most trustworthy buyers that also have their best interest in mind. </p>			</div>
